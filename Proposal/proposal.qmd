# Lets’ Track Public Dollars! Unveiling the G2B Network from GeBiz

## Motivation

Government procurement represents billions in public spending annually, directly impacting taxpayers and the business ecosystem. Despite initiatives like GeBIZ that ostensibly promote transparency, meaningful public oversight remains challenging. Our team's experience attempting to analyze this data revealed significant barriers to understanding: scattered information across thousands of entries, complex relationships between agencies and suppliers, and limited tools to identify patterns or anomalies in spending.

## Problem statement

While raw procurement data is technically "available," several critical issues prevent it from being truly accessible:

1.  Information Overload: The volume and complexity of government tender data overwhelm ordinary citizens.

2.  Limited Visualization: Current platforms present data in tabular formats without meaningful visual representations of relationships or trends.

3.  Hidden Patterns: Important insights about procurement patterns, supplier dominance, and potential inefficiencies remain buried in spreadsheets.

4.  Accessibility Barriers: Technical knowledge requirements effectively restrict who can meaningfully engage with and interpret public spending information.

## Proposed solution 

To bridge this gap, our project "Let’s Track Public Dollars! Unveiling the G2B Network from GeBiz" aims to address these challenges by developing an intuitive Shiny dashboard that transforms complex procurement data into accessible and insightful visualizations.

The application will leverage:

-   **Machine Learning-Based Tender Categorization**: Uses text analysis to classify tenders via its description, enabling grouped analysis by supervised category to reveal agency procurement trends and supplier market dominance.

-   **Procurement Dashboard:** Visualises procurement trends over time, revealing seasonal patterns, supplier shifts, and spending changes by tender type. It also analyzes market concentration and supplier dominance.

-   **Network Analysis**: Visualises agency-supplier relationships and identifies key players in procurement clusters. Features multiple filters by tender category, agencies, suppliers, and date ranges with highlights of top suppliers and agencies.

Through these visual analytics approaches, users will understand immediately: 

-   How government spending flows & distribution between agencies and suppliers 
-   Which suppliers dominate particular agency relationships 
-   How procurement patterns evolve over fiscal periods 
-   Where potential opportunities exist for new market entrants 
-   Whether procurement appears appropriately distributed or concentrated 

Our solutions will empower citizens, businesses, and policymakers with the tool to understand government spending, and contracts without specialised technical knowledge. Ultimately we want to promote greater accountability by shedding light on procurement patterns, key suppliers, and competitive landscapes, as well as informed public resource allocation.

## Methodology 

The project will employ a modular data-driven approach to uncover insights from government procurement data using interactive dashboards, topic modeling, and network analysis techniques. By integrating advanced visualization and machine learning methods, the system will provide a comprehensive, transparent, and engaging analytical tool for public procurement monitoring. The planning modules include the following: 

### Module 1. Machine Learning Based Tender Classification

#### Module Owner: Chang Fang Yu

#### **Core Functionality**

This module adopts a complete **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) text modeling** approach to automatically categorize government tenders based on procurement descriptions. It comprises two key submodules:

1.  **LDA Supervised Classification**, which uses predefined procurement categories to train the model and label tenders accordingly

2.  **LDA Clustering (Unsupervised)**, which allows users to explore underlying topic structures without category supervision.

Users can control the **sample size** (e.g., 1,000, 5,000, 10,000, or all) from a pre-cleaned dataset (`Cleaned_GP_LDA.csv`) and then conduct analysis accordingly. This flexibility allows scalable experimentation and ensures robust and interpretable insights from both supervised and unsupervised LDA.

### **Implemented Components**

#### 1. **Data Selection & Sampling**

-   Users begin by selecting a sample size from the full cleaned tender dataset.

-   The app draws random samples from `Cleaned_GP_LDA.csv`, which has undergone preprocessing (punctuation removal, case normalization, stopword removal).

-   This step ensures consistency and readiness for text modeling.

#### 2. **LDA Supervised Classification**

**Objective**: Train an LDA model using 7 predefined procurement categories, then assign one category to each tender.

**Workflow**:

-   An LDA model is trained with a fixed number of topics (`k = 7`) using pre-annotated labels.

-   Each tender is assigned to a category based on the most probable topic.

-   The labeled dataset is exported (`tender_lda_labeled_all.csv`) for downstream analysis.

**User Controls & Visualizations**:

-   **Word count selector**: Choose the number of top words to display per category.

-   **LDA Category Filter**: Focus on one or all categories.

-   **LDA Distribution Chart**: View the number of tenders per category

-   **TF-IDF Table**: Examine top words by TF-IDF per category.

-   **Wordcloud**: Visualize dominant words per category.

-   **TF-IDF Bar Chart**: Explore the top terms and their TF-IDF scores in a bar plot.

**Key Benefits**:

-   Enables consistent labeling of tenders using domain-specific procurement logic.

-   Provides clear visual patterns for each procurement category.

#### 3. **LDA Clustering (Unsupervised)**

**Objective**: Explore latent structures in tender descriptions without using predefined labels.

**Workflow**:

-   The user specifies the number of clusters `k` and a fixed topic number (`k = 10`) for the LDA model.

-   After modeling, a **k-means algorithm** is applied to cluster the tender-topic matrix.

-   Each cluster reveals a pattern of topic distribution and representative keywords.

**Visual Outputs**:

-   **All Cluster View**: Visualize how tenders are grouped by topic across different clusters.

-   **Single Cluster View**: Drill into a specific cluster to analyze its topic weight and top words.

-   **TF-IDF Insights**: For each topic, the top 5 words with the highest beta values are displayed.

**Key Benefits**:

-   Facilitates discovery of procurement themes not captured by predefined categories.

-   Highlights hidden textual patterns in tenders using a data-driven approach.

### **Insights and Value**

-   **Text Pattern Discovery**: Identify linguistic and thematic patterns in tender descriptions using both guided and unguided modeling.

-   **Flexible Exploration**: Support user-defined sampling, keyword visualization, and model configuration.

-   **Supports Strategic Analysis**: Enables users to better understand procurement trends, supplier profiles, and category distributions.

    **Component Owner: Chang Fang Yu**

-   **Interactive Controls** Unified control panel with filters for date ranges, agencies, suppliers, tender types and award amounts.

#### Specific insights: 

-   **Real-time Procurement Trends** : Visualisation of temporal spending patterns including month-over-month changes, year-over-year comparisons, and identification of peak procurement periods tied to budget cycles.
-   **Agency-Level Procurement Analysis** : Identification of top spending agencies with their specialization patterns. Enable comparative analysis to spot unusual procurement behaviors and spending anomalies.
-   **Supplier Market Presence** : Track key suppliers, awarded contracts, and market concentration.

#### Implement components: 

1.  Interactive network visualisation (core) 
2.  Filtering and control panel (core) 
3.  Network metrics dashboard (core) 
4.  Community detection 
5.  Entity focus view 

#### Specific insights:
