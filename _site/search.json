    "text": "The meeting notes below document the 3rd discussion among group members and consultation with Professor Kam.\n\nDate: 4pm, March 11, 2025\n\n\nAttendees: Cathy, Fangyu, Prof. Kam\n\n\nDiscussion\n1 Procurement Dashboard & Visualization\n\nCathy presented the proposal outline and storyboard for the Procurement dashboard and Network analysis.\nProf. Kam’s feedback\n\nImplement user flexibility to select the top N number of agencies/suppliers when visualizing dashboard data.\nCreate interactive bar charts where users can click on specific agencies/suppliers to trigger dynamic metrics tables with relevant information, rather than displaying static tables.\nReplace individual month selectors with calendar selectors or quarterly options (Q1, Q2, etc.) to better represent ordinal data and reveal seasonal patterns.\nUtilise Treemaps to visualize agency hierarchy by ministry, enabling better drill-down functionality. Add interactivity to display additional information, such as the top five suppliers for any selected agency.\n\n\n2 Network Graph Visualization\n\nCathy presented the three-tab design concept for the procurement network dashboards.\nProf. Kam’s feedback\n\nCalculate node centrality metrics first to enable community construction. These centrality indices will provide critical analytical information for outcomes.\nImplement user selection of centrality measurement types, allowing the network graph to update based on the selected method.\nIntegrate community detection/analysis within the initial “Visualisation” tab, followed by deeper analysis based on community findings.\n[Note: Cathy inquired if community detection could remain as a standalone tab. Prof. Kam recommended further exploration before making this decision.]\n\n\n3 Text Analysis & Topic Modeling\n\nFangyu demonstrated the text analysis storyboard and current progress, including the LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) topic modeling and clustering techniques used to identify key procurement themes.\nProf. Kam’s feedback\n\nEmphasized the importance of interactive data refinement to continuously improve classification accuracy.\nRecommended training a model to label each tender type, referencing the book “Text Modeling with R” to establish a standardized categorization process.\nSuggested revised approaches for LDA modeling utilizing TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) metrics while maintaining the tidytext approach.\nProposed re-ordering the tabs within the module: Learning Data &gt; Word Cloud &gt; Text Analysis &gt; LDA Text Modeling (since LDA itself is a clustering analysis for classification).\nRecommended restructuring the overall module flow: Begin with Text Analysis to derive tender classification results &gt; Incorporate these results into Network Analysis to generate more insightful visualizations.\n\n\n4 Additional Notes (Text Analysis Techniques):\n\nTF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Identifies the most representative keywords to enhance topic modeling accuracy.\nText Cleaning: Ensures clean textual data (removing stop words, special characters, punctuation, etc.) for higher-quality analysis.\nLDA Refinement Process: The LDA model should be iteratively refined to achieve the purest possible categorization, enhancing the clarity and accuracy of procurement descriptions.\n\nShiny App Development & Integration\n\nTeam had questions about code compilation and implementing a sophisticated Shiny app interface similar to previous student work.\nProf Kam’s feedback\n\nTeam members should develop modules separately but eventually compile all code into a single Shiny web app file for publication on Shinyapps.io (one link only to be used on Netlify).\nBefore code compilation, the team must agree on a consistent menu design across all modules to ensure consistent rendering and expected results.\n\n\n5 Next steps\n\nFangYu to continue refining the text classification module implementing Prof. Kam’s recommended approaches by the next milestone.\nCathy to redesign the interactive procurement network visualization incorporating feedback on centrality metrics and community detection.\n\n\n\nSchedule another consultation with Prof. Kam at the next project milestone to review progress."

Agency Name Cleaning\nThe agency names in SGentities.csv (EN) were standardized by: Removing abbreviations in parentheses (e.g., “Ministry of Education (MOE)” → “Ministry of Education”). Converting to lowercase. Trimming extra spaces. Removing punctuation and special characters. Reason: Standardized names improve the accuracy of matching between procurement records and agency classifications. Handling Missing SUBCAT Values\nIf SUBCAT was missing, it was replaced with its corresponding CATEGORY. Reason: Ensures hierarchical classification remains complete and prevents missing values in the dataset. Direct Matching of Agencies\nThe cleaned agency column in GP was directly matched to NAME_CLEAN in EN using left_join(). Reason: To map each procurement record to its corresponding agency category. Fuzzy Matching for Unmatched Agencies\nAgencies that were not matched directly were processed using stringdist_left_join() with Jaro-Winkler distance (max_dist = 0.3). Reason: Accounts for minor spelling variations, ensuring more robust name matching. Final Data Validation and Export\nAny remaining missing values in SUBCAT were replaced with CATEGORY. The cleaned datasets were saved as Cleaned_Tenders.csv and Processed_SGentities.csv.\nReason: Ensures that all records are categorized correctly, enabling further analysis and visualization. Final Outcome After preprocessing, all procurement records (GP) were successfully mapped to their respective CATEGORY and SUBCAT. There were no missing values, ensuring a well-structured dataset for machine learning models and visual analysis.\nThis preprocessing was necessary to:\n\nEnable accurate trend analysis and clustering.\nEnsure hierarchical classification for structured reporting.\nImprove matching accuracy between procurement records and government entities.\nPrepare the data for machine learning-based classification and NLP-based insights.\n\nWith this cleaned data, the next steps could involve topic modeling (LDA), classification modeling, or interactive dashboard visualization.\nResult Table\n\n\nResult: Cleaned_GP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntender_no\ntender_description\nagency\naward_date\ntender_detail_status\nsupplier_name\nawarded_amt\nagency_clean\nNAME\nCATEGORY\nSUBCAT\n\n\n\n\nACR000ETT18300010\nSUPPLY, DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, CUSTOMIZATION, DELIVERY, INSTALLATION, TESTING, COMMISSIONING AND MAINTENANCE OF A VARIABLE CAPITAL COMPANIES (VCC) SYSTEM FOR ACCOUNTING AND CORPORATE REGULARTORY AUTHORITY\nAccounting And Corporate Regulatory Authority\n2019-06-11\nAwarded to Suppliers\nAZAAS PTE.
