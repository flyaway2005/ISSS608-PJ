Add interactivity to display additional information, such as the top five suppliers for any selected agency.\n\n\n2 Network Graph Visualization\n\nCathy presented the three-tab design concept for the procurement network dashboards.\nProf. Kam’s feedback\n\nCalculate node centrality metrics first to enable community construction. These centrality indices will provide critical analytical information for outcomes.\nImplement user selection of centrality measurement types, allowing the network graph to update based on the selected method.\nIntegrate community detection/analysis within the initial “Visualisation” tab, followed by deeper analysis based on community findings.\n[Note: Cathy inquired if community detection could remain as a standalone tab. Prof. Kam recommended further exploration before making this decision.]\n\n\n3 Text Analysis & Topic Modeling\n\nFangyu demonstrated the text analysis storyboard and current progress, including the LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) topic modeling and clustering techniques used to identify key procurement themes.\nProf. Kam’s feedback\n\nEmphasized the importance of interactive data refinement to continuously improve classification accuracy.\nRecommended training a model to label each tender type, referencing the book “Text Modeling with R” to establish a standardized categorization process.\nSuggested revised approaches for LDA modeling utilizing TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) metrics while maintaining the tidytext approach.\nProposed re-ordering the tabs within the module: Learning Data &gt; Word Cloud &gt; Text Analysis &gt; LDA Text Modeling (since LDA itself is a clustering analysis for classification).\nRecommended restructuring the overall module flow: Begin with Text Analysis to derive tender classification results &gt; Incorporate these results into Network Analysis to generate more insightful visualizations.\n\n\n4 Additional Notes (Text Analysis Techniques):\n\nTF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Identifies the most representative keywords to enhance topic modeling accuracy.\nText Cleaning: Ensures clean textual data (removing stop words, special characters, punctuation, etc.) for higher-quality analysis.\nLDA Refinement Process: The LDA model should be iteratively refined to achieve the purest possible categorization, enhancing the clarity and accuracy of procurement descriptions.\n\nShiny App Development & Integration\n\nTeam had questions about code compilation and implementing a sophisticated Shiny app interface similar to previous student work.\nProf Kam’s feedback\n\nTeam members should develop modules separately but eventually compile all code into a single Shiny web app file for publication on Shinyapps.io (one link only to be used on Netlify).\nBefore code compilation, the team must agree on a consistent menu design across all modules to ensure consistent rendering and expected results.\n\n\n5 Next steps\n\nFangYu to continue refining the text classification module implementing Prof. Kam’s recommended approaches by the next milestone.\nCathy to redesign the interactive procurement network visualization incorporating feedback on centrality metrics and community detection.\n\n\n\nSchedule another consultation with Prof. Kam at the next project milestone to review progress."

    "text": "Project Github\n\n\nGovernment procurement represents billions in public spending annually, directly impacting taxpayers and the business ecosystem. Despite initiatives like GeBIZ that ostensibly promote transparency, meaningful public oversight remains challenging. Our team’s experience attempting to analyze this data revealed significant barriers to understanding: scattered information across thousands of entries, complex relationships between agencies and suppliers, and limited tools to identify patterns or anomalies in spending.\n\n\n\nWhile raw procurement data is technically “available,” several critical issues prevent it from being truly accessible:\n\nInformation Overload: The volume and complexity of government tender data overwhelm ordinary citizens.\nLimited Visualization: Current platforms present data in tabular formats without meaningful visual representations of relationships or trends.\nHidden Patterns: Important insights about procurement patterns, supplier dominance, and potential inefficiencies remain buried in spreadsheets.\nAccessibility Barriers: Technical knowledge requirements effectively restrict who can meaningfully engage with and interpret public spending information.\n\n\n\n\nTo bridge this gap, our project “Let’s Track Public Dollars! Unveiling the G2B Network from GeBiz” aims to address these challenges by developing an intuitive Shiny dashboard that transforms complex procurement data into accessible and insightful visualizations.\nThe application will leverage:\n\nMachine Learning-Based Tender Categorization: Uses text analysis to classify tenders via its description, enabling grouped analysis by supervised category to reveal agency procurement trends and supplier market dominance.\nProcurement Dashboard: Visualises procurement trends over time, revealing seasonal patterns, supplier shifts, and spending changes by tender type. It also analyzes market concentration and supplier dominance.\nNetwork Analysis: Visualises agency-supplier relationships and identifies key players in procurement clusters. Features multiple filters by tender category, agencies, suppliers, and date ranges with highlights of top suppliers and agencies.\n\nThrough these visual analytics approaches, users will understand immediately: \n\nHow government spending flows & distribution between agencies and suppliers \nWhich suppliers dominate particular agency relationships \nHow procurement patterns evolve over fiscal periods \nWhere potential opportunities exist for new market entrants \nWhether procurement appears appropriately distributed or concentrated \n\nOur solutions will empower citizens, businesses, and policymakers with the tool to understand government spending, and contracts without specialised technical knowledge. Ultimately we want to promote greater accountability by shedding light on procurement patterns, key suppliers, and competitive landscapes, as well as informed public resource allocation.\n\n\n\nGeBIZ (Government Electronic Business Platform), containing 18,638 entries from 2019 to 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntender_no\ntender_description\nagency\naward_date\ntender_detail_status\nsupplier_name\nawarded_amt\n\n\n\n\nACR000ETT18300010\nSUPPLY, DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, CUSTOMIZATION, DELIVERY, INSTALLATION, TESTING, COMMISSIONING AND MAINTENANCE OF A VARIABLE CAPITAL COMPANIES (VCC) SYSTEM FOR ACCOUNTING AND CORPORATE REGULARTORY AUTHORITY\nAccounting And Corporate Regulatory Authority\n11/6/2019\nAwarded to Suppliers\nAZAAS PTE.

By integrating advanced visualization and machine learning methods, the system will provide a comprehensive, transparent, and engaging analytical tool for public procurement monitoring. The planning modules include the following: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis module adopts a complete Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) text modeling approach to automatically categorize government tenders based on procurement descriptions. It comprises two key submodules:\n\nLDA Supervised Classification, which uses predefined procurement categories to train the model and label tenders accordingly\nLDA Clustering (Unsupervised), which allows users to explore underlying topic structures without category supervision.\n\nUsers can control the sample size (e.g., 1,000, 5,000, 10,000, or all) from a pre-cleaned dataset (Cleaned_GP_LDA.csv) and then conduct analysis accordingly.

    "text": "To bridge this gap, our project “Let’s Track Public Dollars! Unveiling the G2B Network from GeBiz” aims to address these challenges by developing an intuitive Shiny dashboard that transforms complex procurement data into accessible and insightful visualizations.\nThe application will leverage:\n\nMachine Learning-Based Tender Categorization: Uses text analysis to classify tenders via its description, enabling grouped analysis by supervised category to reveal agency procurement trends and supplier market dominance.\nProcurement Dashboard: Visualises procurement trends over time, revealing seasonal patterns, supplier shifts, and spending changes by tender type. It also analyzes market concentration and supplier dominance.\nNetwork Analysis: Visualises agency-supplier relationships and identifies key players in procurement clusters. Features multiple filters by tender category, agencies, suppliers, and date ranges with highlights of top suppliers and agencies.\n\nThrough these visual analytics approaches, users will understand immediately: \n\nHow government spending flows & distribution between agencies and suppliers \nWhich suppliers dominate particular agency relationships \nHow procurement patterns evolve over fiscal periods \nWhere potential opportunities exist for new market entrants \nWhether procurement appears appropriately distributed or concentrated \n\nOur solutions will empower citizens, businesses, and policymakers with the tool to understand government spending, and contracts without specialised technical knowledge. Ultimately we want to promote greater accountability by shedding light on procurement patterns, key suppliers, and competitive landscapes, as well as informed public resource allocation."
