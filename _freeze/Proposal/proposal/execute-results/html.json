Unveiling the G2B Network from GeBiz\n\n## Motivation\n\nGovernment procurement represents billions in public spending annually, directly impacting taxpayers and the business ecosystem. Despite initiatives like GeBIZ that ostensibly promote transparency, meaningful public oversight remains challenging. Our team's experience attempting to analyze this data revealed significant barriers to understanding: scattered information across thousands of entries, complex relationships between agencies and suppliers, and limited tools to identify patterns or anomalies in spending.\n\n## Problem statement\n\nWhile raw procurement data is technically \"available,\" several critical issues prevent it from being truly accessible:\n\n1.  Information Overload: The volume and complexity of government tender data overwhelm ordinary citizens.\n\n2.  Limited Visualization: Current platforms present data in tabular formats without meaningful visual representations of relationships or trends.\n\n3.  Hidden Patterns: Important insights about procurement patterns, supplier dominance, and potential inefficiencies remain buried in spreadsheets.\n\n4.  Accessibility Barriers: Technical knowledge requirements effectively restrict who can meaningfully engage with and interpret public spending information.\n\n## Proposed solution \n\nTo bridge this gap, our project \" Lets’ Track Public Dollars! Unveiling the G2B Network from GeBiz \" aims to address these challenges by developing an intuitive Shiny dashboard that transforms complex procurement data into accessible visual insights.  \n\nThe application will leverage: \n\n-   Network analysis: Reveals relationship patterns between government agencies and suppliers, identifying key players, procurement communities, and the flow of public funds \n-   Temporal visualisation: Tracks procurement trends over time, highlighting seasonal patterns, evolving supplier relationships, and changes in government spending priorities \n-   Competitive intelligence: Maps market concentration, spending distributions, and supplier dominance across different government sectors, enabling analysis of procurement fairness and efficiency \n-   Text analysis: Discovers common themes and requirements in tender descriptions through interactive word clouds, helping users understand what government agencies are purchasing \n\nThrough these visual analytics approaches, users will understand immediately: \n\n-   How government spending flows & distribution between agencies and suppliers \n-   Which suppliers dominate particular agency relationships \n-   How procurement patterns evolve over fiscal periods \n-   Where potential opportunities exist for new market entrants \n-   Whether procurement appears appropriately distributed or concentrated \n\nOur solutions will empower citizens, businesses, and policymakers with the tool to understand government spending, and contracts without specialised technical knowledge. Ultimately we want to promote greater accountability by shedding light on procurement patterns, key suppliers, and competitive landscapes, as well as informed public resource allocation.\n\n##   Data\n\n[GeBIZ](https://www.gebiz.gov.sg/) (Government Electronic Business Platform), containing 18,638 entries from 2019 to 2023.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n\t/var/folders/zr/rjd69mws5mz_fncmw5z7njtw0000gn/T//RtmpD460hV/downloaded_packages\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|tender_no         |tender_description                                                                                                                                                                                         |agency                                        |award_date |tender_detail_status    |supplier_name                            | awarded_amt|\n|:-----------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|:----------|:-----------------------|:----------------------------------------|-----------:|\n|ACR000ETT18300010 |SUPPLY, DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, CUSTOMIZATION, DELIVERY, INSTALLATION, TESTING, COMMISSIONING AND MAINTENANCE OF A VARIABLE CAPITAL COMPANIES (VCC) SYSTEM FOR ACCOUNTING AND CORPORATE REGULARTORY AUTHORITY |Accounting And Corporate Regulatory Authority |11/6/2019  |Awarded to Suppliers    |AZAAS PTE.
