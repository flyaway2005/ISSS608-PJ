Unveiling the G2B Network from GeBiz\n\n## Motivation\n\nGovernment procurement represents billions in public spending annually, directly impacting taxpayers and the business ecosystem. Despite initiatives like GeBIZ that ostensibly promote transparency, meaningful public oversight remains challenging. Our team's experience attempting to analyze this data revealed significant barriers to understanding: scattered information across thousands of entries, complex relationships between agencies and suppliers, and limited tools to identify patterns or anomalies in spending.\n\n## Problem statement\n\nWhile raw procurement data is technically \"available,\" several critical issues prevent it from being truly accessible:\n\n1.  Information Overload: The volume and complexity of government tender data overwhelm ordinary citizens.\n\n2.  Limited Visualization: Current platforms present data in tabular formats without meaningful visual representations of relationships or trends.\n\n3.  Hidden Patterns: Important insights about procurement patterns, supplier dominance, and potential inefficiencies remain buried in spreadsheets.\n\n4.  Accessibility Barriers: Technical knowledge requirements effectively restrict who can meaningfully engage with and interpret public spending information.\n\n## Proposed solution \n\nTo bridge this gap, our project \"Let’s Track Public Dollars! Unveiling the G2B Network from GeBiz\" aims to address these challenges by developing an intuitive Shiny dashboard that transforms complex procurement data into accessible and insightful visualizations.\n\nThe application will leverage:\n\n-   **Machine Learning-Based Tender Categorization**: Uses text analysis to classify tenders via its description, enabling grouped analysis by category to reveal agency procurement trends and supplier market dominance.\n\n-   **Procurement Dashboard:** Visualises procurement trends over time, revealing seasonal patterns, supplier shifts, and spending changes by tender type. It also analyzes market concentration and supplier dominance.\n\n-   **Network Analysis**: Visualises agency-supplier relationships and identifies key players in procurement clusters. Features multiple filters by tender category, agencies, suppliers, and date ranges with highlights of top suppliers and agencies.\n\nThrough these visual analytics approaches, users will understand immediately: \n\n-   How government spending flows & distribution between agencies and suppliers \n-   Which suppliers dominate particular agency relationships \n-   How procurement patterns evolve over fiscal periods \n-   Where potential opportunities exist for new market entrants \n-   Whether procurement appears appropriately distributed or concentrated \n\nOur solutions will empower citizens, businesses, and policymakers with the tool to understand government spending, and contracts without specialised technical knowledge. Ultimately we want to promote greater accountability by shedding light on procurement patterns, key suppliers, and competitive landscapes, as well as informed public resource allocation.\n\n## Data\n\n[GeBIZ](https://www.gebiz.gov.sg/) (Government Electronic Business Platform), containing 18,638 entries from 2019 to 2023.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|tender_no         |tender_description                                                                                                                                                                                         |agency                                        |award_date |tender_detail_status    |supplier_name                            | awarded_amt|\n|:-----------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|:----------|:-----------------------|:----------------------------------------|-----------:|\n|ACR000ETT18300010 |SUPPLY, DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, CUSTOMIZATION, DELIVERY, INSTALLATION, TESTING, COMMISSIONING AND MAINTENANCE OF A VARIABLE CAPITAL COMPANIES (VCC) SYSTEM FOR ACCOUNTING AND CORPORATE REGULARTORY AUTHORITY |Accounting And Corporate Regulatory Authority |11/6/2019  |Awarded to Suppliers    |AZAAS PTE.

By integrating advanced visualization and machine learning methods, the system will provide a comprehensive, transparent, and engaging analytical tool for public procurement monitoring. The planning modules include the following: \n\n### Module 1. Machine Learning Based Tender Classification\n\n#### Core functionality:\n\nThis component aims to automatically categorize tenders by analyzing procurement descriptions using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. By implementing LDA topic modeling, TF-IDF-based text analysis, and a trained classification model, we can label tenders with meaningful categories. These labels will then be used for trend analysis, procurement pattern identification, and supplier-agency relationship insights.\n\n#### Implement Components:\n\n**1. Data Preprocessing & Text Cleaning**\n\n-   **Objective:** Prepare tender descriptions for accurate text analysis and machine learning classification.\n\n**2. LDA Topic Modeling & Tender Clustering**\n\n-   **Objective:** Identify potential procurement categories based on tender descriptions.\n\n**3. Machine Learning Model Training & Tender Labeling**\n\n-   **Objective:** Train a supervised learning model to automatically label tenders based on discovered categories.\n\n#### **Specific Insights:**\n\n-   **Identifies key procurement categories**: based on tender descriptions.\n\n-   **Improves supplier-agency analysis**: by grouping tenders based on category labels.\n\n### Module 2. Procurement Dashboard  \n\n#### Core functionality: \n\nThe Procurement Dashboard is an interactive module providing real-time insights into procurement activities, supplier competition, and market dynamics. By leveraging advanced visualization, filtering, and anomaly detection, it offers a comprehensive and transparent view of procurement trends.\n\n#### Implement components: \n\n*to update*\n\n#### Specific insights: \n\n-   **Real-time Procurement Trends** : Monitor spending, contract awards, and supplier distribution over time.\n-   **Agency-Level Procurement Analysis** : Identify top-spending agencies and their procurement patterns.\n-   **Supplier Market Presence** : Track key suppliers, awarded contracts, and market concentration.\n-   **Market Share & Competitive Analysis** : Evaluate supplier dominance, competition, and procurement fairness across agencies.\n\n### Module 3. G2B Procurement Networks  \n\n#### Core functionality: \n\nA network graph visualization will be developed to illustrate the relationships between government agencies and suppliers based on procurement transactions.  \n\n#### Implement components: \n\n1.  Interactive network visualisation (core) \n2.  Filtering and control panel (core) \n3.  Network metrics dashboard (core) \n4.  Community detection \n5.  Entity focus view \n\n#### Specific insights: \n\n-   **Agency-supplier collaboration:** which agencies work most frequently with specific suppliers \n-   **Network centrality analysis:** Identify central nodes in procurement networks \n-   **Community detection:** will reveal clusters of agencies and suppliers that frequently collaborate. \n\n## **Prototype** \n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Tender Classification\n\nTo update\n\n## Procurement Dashboard\n\n![](images/Temp_1-01.png)\n\n![](images/Temp_2-01.png)\n\n![](images/Temp_3-02.png)\n\n## Network Analysis\n\n**Network visualisation** \n![](images/Network_1-01.png)\n\n**Community detection** \n![](images/Network_2-01.png)\n\n**Network metrics** \n\n![](images/Network_3-01.png)\n:::\n",
