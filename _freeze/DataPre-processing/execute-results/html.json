Agency Name Cleaning\n\nThe agency names in SGentities.csv (EN) were standardized by: Removing abbreviations in parentheses (e.g., \"Ministry of Education (MOE)\" → \"Ministry of Education\"). Converting to lowercase. Trimming extra spaces. Removing punctuation and special characters. Reason: Standardized names improve the accuracy of matching between procurement records and agency classifications. Handling Missing SUBCAT Values\n\nIf SUBCAT was missing, it was replaced with its corresponding CATEGORY. Reason: Ensures hierarchical classification remains complete and prevents missing values in the dataset. Direct Matching of Agencies\n\nThe cleaned agency column in GP was directly matched to NAME_CLEAN in EN using left_join(). Reason: To map each procurement record to its corresponding agency category. Fuzzy Matching for Unmatched Agencies\n\nAgencies that were not matched directly were processed using stringdist_left_join() with Jaro-Winkler distance (max_dist = 0.3). Reason: Accounts for minor spelling variations, ensuring more robust name matching. Final Data Validation and Export\n\nAny remaining missing values in SUBCAT were replaced with CATEGORY. The cleaned datasets were saved as Cleaned_Tenders.csv and Processed_SGentities.csv.\n\nReason: Ensures that all records are categorized correctly, enabling further analysis and visualization. Final Outcome After preprocessing, all procurement records (GP) were successfully mapped to their respective CATEGORY and SUBCAT. There were no missing values, ensuring a well-structured dataset for machine learning models and visual analysis.\n\nThis preprocessing was necessary to:\n\n-   Enable accurate trend analysis and clustering.\n\n-   Ensure hierarchical classification for structured reporting.\n\n-   Improve matching accuracy between procurement records and government entities.\n\n-   Prepare the data for machine learning-based classification and NLP-based insights.\n\nWith this cleaned data, the next steps could involve topic modeling (LDA), classification modeling, or interactive dashboard visualization.\n\nResult Table\n\n### Result: Cleaned_GP\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|tender_no         |tender_description                                                                                                                                                                                         |agency                                        |award_date |tender_detail_status    |supplier_name                            | awarded_amt|agency_clean                                  |NAME                                                 |CATEGORY         |SUBCAT           |\n|:-----------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|:----------|:-----------------------|:----------------------------------------|-----------:|:---------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------|:----------------|:----------------|\n|ACR000ETT18300010 |SUPPLY, DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, CUSTOMIZATION, DELIVERY, INSTALLATION, TESTING, COMMISSIONING AND MAINTENANCE OF A VARIABLE CAPITAL COMPANIES (VCC) SYSTEM FOR ACCOUNTING AND CORPORATE REGULARTORY AUTHORITY |Accounting And Corporate Regulatory Authority |2019-06-11 |Awarded to Suppliers    |AZAAS PTE.
