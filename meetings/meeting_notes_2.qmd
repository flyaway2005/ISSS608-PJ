The meeting notes below document the 2nd discussion among group members.

#### **Date: 9pm, March 6, 2025**

#### **Attendees:** Cathy, Fangyu

#### **Discussion**

***1 Nowcasting Data Requirements***

-   Fangyu consulted on Piazza about nowcasting data frequency requirements, noting that most government datasets only update quarterly or annually, with approximately five datasets updating monthly. 
-   *\[Prof. Kam clarified that best practices for nowcasting require monthly data updates.*
-   Based on data availability constraints, Fangyu suggested Network analysis as a more feasible research direction. 

***2 Procurement Data Analysis Opportunities***

-   Cathy proposed that government procurement data could support multiple analysis approaches beyond Network analysis, including:  

    -   Temporal analysis to identify trends and patterns over time 

    -   Text analysis of tender descriptions for insights (including Word Cloud visualization) 

***3 Text Analysis Approach***

-   Fangyu proposed leveraging text analysis techniques specifically for Word Cloud visualisations of the procurement data. 

**Team agreed with the proposals and will work on the following action items.** 

***4 Action Items*** 

-   Cathy will start developing a comprehensive storyboard for the Network analysis module. 
-   Fangyu will begin text analysis implementation and create an initial prototype.
