The meeting notes below document the 3rd discussion among group members and consultation with Professor Kam.

## Meeing 3

#### **Date: 4pm, March 11, 2025**

#### **Attendees:** Cathy, Fangyu, Prof. Kam

#### **Discussion**

***1 Procurement Dashboard & Visualization***

-   Cathy presented the proposal outline and storyboard for the Procurement dashboard and Network analysis.
-   **Prof. Kam's feedback**
    -   Implement user flexibility to select the top N number of agencies/suppliers when visualizing dashboard data.
    -   Create interactive bar charts where users can click on specific agencies/suppliers to trigger dynamic metrics tables with relevant information, rather than displaying static tables.
    -   Replace individual month selectors with calendar selectors or quarterly options (Q1, Q2, etc.) to better represent ordinal data and reveal seasonal patterns.
    -   Utilise Treemaps to visualize agency hierarchy by ministry, enabling better drill-down functionality. Add interactivity to display additional information, such as the top five suppliers for any selected agency.

***2 Network Graph Visualization***

-   Cathy presented the three-tab design concept for the procurement network dashboards.
-   **Prof. Kam's feedback**
    -   Calculate node centrality metrics first to enable community construction. These centrality indices will provide critical analytical information for outcomes.
    -   Implement user selection of centrality measurement types, allowing the network graph to update based on the selected method.
    -   Integrate community detection/analysis within the initial "Visualisation" tab, followed by deeper analysis based on community findings.
    -   *\[Note: Cathy inquired if community detection could remain as a standalone tab. Prof. Kam recommended further exploration before making this decision.\]*

***3 Text Analysis & Topic Modeling***

-   Fangyu demonstrated the text analysis storyboard and current progress, including the LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) topic modeling and clustering techniques used to identify key procurement themes.

-   **Prof. Kam's feedback**

    -   Emphasized the importance of interactive data refinement to continuously improve classification accuracy.

    -   Recommended training a model to label each tender type, referencing the book "Text Modeling with R" to establish a standardized categorization process.

    -   Suggested revised approaches for LDA modeling utilizing TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) metrics while maintaining the tidytext approach.

    -   Proposed re-ordering the tabs within the module: Learning Data \> Word Cloud \> Text Analysis \> LDA Text Modeling (since LDA itself is a clustering analysis for classification).

    -   Recommended restructuring the overall module flow: Begin with Text Analysis to derive tender classification results \> Incorporate these results into Network Analysis to generate more insightful visualizations.

***4 Additional Notes (Text Analysis Techniques):***

-   *TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):* Identifies the most representative keywords to enhance topic modeling accuracy.

-   *Text Cleaning:* Ensures clean textual data (removing stop words, special characters, punctuation, etc.) for higher-quality analysis.

-   *LDA Refinement Process:* The LDA model should be iteratively refined to achieve the purest possible categorization, enhancing the clarity and accuracy of procurement descriptions.

***Shiny App Development & Integration***

-   Team had questions about code compilation and implementing a sophisticated Shiny app interface similar to previous student work.
-   **Prof Kamâ€™s feedback**
    -   Team members should develop modules separately but eventually compile all code into a single Shiny web app file for publication on Shinyapps.io (one link only to be used on Netlify).
    -   Before code compilation, the team must agree on a consistent menu design across all modules to ensure consistent rendering and expected results.

***5 Next steps***

-   FangYu to continue refining the text classification module implementing Prof. Kam's recommended approaches by the next milestone.

-   Cathy to redesign the interactive procurement network visualization incorporating feedback on centrality metrics and community detection.

-   Schedule another consultation with Prof. Kam at the next project milestone to review progress.
